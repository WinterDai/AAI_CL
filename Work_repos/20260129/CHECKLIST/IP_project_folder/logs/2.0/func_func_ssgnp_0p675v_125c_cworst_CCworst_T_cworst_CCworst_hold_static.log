**WARN: (TCLCMD-1233):	The -view option should be specified for the command write_timing_windows in MMMC mode.

The inconsistencies reported above were found among the technologies of the libraries being merged or linked together. The actual technology stored in the merged library is a subset of the data from the original libraries. This data has been written to the text file "technology.pick".
 If this library will be used to provide the technology data required to extract DEF files, it is the user's responsibility to inspect this file, and verify that the technology data is correct with respect to the DEF. If the data is not correct, try changing the order in which the input libraries are specified, or use the Libgen tool to manually merge the libraries.  See the Libgen documentation for more information on manually merging libraries.
