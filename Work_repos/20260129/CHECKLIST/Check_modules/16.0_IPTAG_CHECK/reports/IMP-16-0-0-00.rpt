FAIL:IMP-16-0-0-00:Confirm the IPTAG content and format are correct.(check the Note)
Fail Occurrence: 4
1: Fail: Configuration: IP Tag delimiter between product name and configuration name: Field validation failed
2: Fail: Delimiter3: Please don't change this item. Release Date Code, Description: Code that uniquely identifies the design based on the date and time the final gds was released.  Considering that a large number of PHY configurations can be generated from the system, the release date code is used to guarantee each customer delivery has a unique code, within one minute granularity.  Field Type: Fixed width [13] Field Contents: Starts with character C, followed by 12 character date code in YYYYMMDDhhmm format, describing the date and time the design was released. The time is captured in hour and minute in 24 hour format.: Field validation failed
3: Fail: Release_Date: IP Tag delimiter between product name and configuration name: Field validation failed
4: Fail: Trailing content after End marker: Field validation failed
