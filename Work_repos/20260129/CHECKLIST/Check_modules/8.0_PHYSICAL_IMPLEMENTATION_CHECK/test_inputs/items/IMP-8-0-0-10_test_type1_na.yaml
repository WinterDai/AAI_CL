description: Confirm you placed the discrete synchronizer flops close to each other
  (distance <= 10um) for process without dedicated 2/3 stage synchronizer library
  cell like TSMC. Make sure “no buffering on the Q->D path between sync flops” for
  the sync_regs falling under same hierarchy. Please fine tune clock tree for hold
  fixing. Please don't change the VT of synchronizer flops. (Check the Note. Fill
  N/A for library has 2/3 stages dedicated library cell)
