description: Confirm you placed the discrete synchronizer flops close to each other
  (distance <= 10um) for process without dedicated 2/3 stage synchronizer library
  cell like TSMC. Make sure “no buffering on the Q->D path between sync flops” for
  the sync_regs falling under same hierarchy. Please fine tune clock tree for hold
  fixing. Please don't change the VT of synchronizer flops. (Check the Note. Fill
  N/A for library has 2/3 stages dedicated library cell)

  waive_items:
  - name: inst_data_path_top/inst_data_byte_macro/WR_CLK_GEN_0__inst_wr_slice_clk_gen/inst_wr_bit_clk_gen/inst_rst_n_clk4x_sync/inst_hic_dff_out
    reason: Waived per design review - low-density region constraint, timing analysis
      confirms acceptable metastability window
  - name: inst_data_path_top/inst_data_byte_macro/RD_CLK_GEN_0__inst_rd_slice_clk_gen/inst_rd_bit_clk_gen/inst_rst_n_clk2x_sync/inst_hic_dff_out
    reason: Waived - mux required for test mode switching, CDC functionality verified
      by simulation
