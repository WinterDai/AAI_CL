FAIL:MIG-IMP-8-1-0-04:Confirm there are no gaps for delay element placement for both NS and EW orientation. Best practice is to place delay element by vertical direction for EW slies. Building PG into EW delay element is another choice to avoid gaps between delay elements. Pay attention to try our best to keep same driven strenght along the READ/WRITE/LPBK path during the DCD fixing (post DQ clock divider).
