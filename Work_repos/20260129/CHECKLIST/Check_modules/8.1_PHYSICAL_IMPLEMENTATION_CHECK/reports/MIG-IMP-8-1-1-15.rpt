FAIL:MIG-IMP-8-1-1-15:Confirm you follow the below implementation guidance related to data_retention and VDDA_AO for GDDR6/GDDR7. -For GDDR6 Gen1 (old architecture), connect the data_retention pin to CMN CORE_VDDGONE directly with shortest distance (please review the transition with AMS team) and don't insert any buffer on data_retention path as there is no VDD always supply in core area. GDDR6 gen1 will not have VDDA_AO supply and VDDA on HM will be always on in data_retention mode. -For GDDR6 new architecture or GDDR7, there will be VDDA_AO bump (please double check with AMS team if there is no VDDA_AO bump), PD need to add data_retention buffers(insert data_retention buffer to PHY boundary also) powered by VDDA_AO.
