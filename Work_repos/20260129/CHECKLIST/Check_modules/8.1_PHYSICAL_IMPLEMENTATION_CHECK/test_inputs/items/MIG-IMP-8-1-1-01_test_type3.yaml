description: Confirm meet a resistance less than 0.5Ω(not exceed 0.8Ω) and a capacitance
  less than 350fF from pad opening to signal bump. (check the Note)
input_files:
- ${CHECKLIST_ROOT}/IP_project_folder/reports/8.1/MIG-IMP-8-1-1-01.rpt
requirements:
  pattern_items:
  - pad_mem_data[47]
  - pad_mem_data[56]
  - pad_mem_clk
  value: 3
waivers:
  value: 2
  waive_items:
  - name: pad_mem_data[12]
    reason: Waived per design review - non-critical debug signal, acceptable for this
      corner
  - name: pad_mem_clk
    reason: Waived - resistance margin acceptable, clock path has sufficient timing
      margin
