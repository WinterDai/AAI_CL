description: 'TODO: Confirm there is no buffers/inverters inserted on the VDDR_OBS/VDDR_1UI_OBS/VDDR_6UI_OBS/ATB0_REG_OBS/ATB1_REG_OBS
  nets from regulator to feedback IO. And make sure the net resistance less than 500ohms.
  For 1UI+6UI case, if the 1UI or 6UI connected to two FBIOs, make sure the path from
  the regulator to the near FBIO resistance less than 500ohms. For regulator to the
  far FBIO path, the resistance can be relaxed. Check with AMS team if you have further
  questions.'
