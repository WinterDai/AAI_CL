description: 'TODO: Confirm assigned VDD_AO bump or create VDD_AO dedicated power
  supply from SOC side to VDD_AO pin of internal data_retention pad depends on the
  communication with customer side if "Does customer intend to shutoff VDD externally"
  is yes in pre2post checklist and "power gating" is no in addendum. (check the Note)
  Pay attention to assign dedicated ESD cells to VDD_AO supply to make sure there
  is no ESD issue if VDD_AO bump is assigned. Make sure the data_retention signal
  path from SOC side is always on ( not powered by PHY VDD as that can be shut off
  externally) Make sure the related_power_pin of data_retention signal in lib files
  should be VDD_AO.'
