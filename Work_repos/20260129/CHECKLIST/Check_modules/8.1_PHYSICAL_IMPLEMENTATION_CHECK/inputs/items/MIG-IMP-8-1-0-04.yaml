description: 'TODO: Confirm there are no gaps for delay element placement for both
  NS and EW orientation. Best practice is to place delay element by vertical direction

  between delay elements. Pay attention to try our best to keep same driven strenght
  along the READ/WRITE/LPBK path during the DCD fixing (post DQ clock divider).'
