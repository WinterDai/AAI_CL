description: Confirm the MIM related check is clean. (Need to check and Fill N/A if
  no MIMCAP inserted or no MIM related layers in PHY or SOC level) - If PHY needs
  to insert MIMCAP. 1. Need to pay attention to the MIMCAP KOZ rule during MIMCAP
  insertion after check with customer about the SOC die size, substrate layer number
  and PHY placement/location in SOC level. 2. Pay attention to the option setting
  related to MIM DRC check like KOZ_High_subst_layer, SHDMIM_KOZ_AP_SPACE_5um(on/off
  will impact the checking rule) etc in TSMC rule deck(need to align these settings
  with customer). -If PHY doesn't insert MIMCAP but SOC level inserts MIMCAP. 1. Need
  to open SHDMIM switching in DRC rule deck. 2. Need to check with customer whether
  PHY need to meet SHDMIM_KOZ_AP_SPACE_5um rule (if SOC level this DRC switching setting
  is ON) in PHY area which falls into SOC KOZ area for TSMC process. 3. May need to
  insert MIM dummy in PHY level to meet SOC level MIM dummy density rule (you can
  sync with customer whether PHY MIM dummy is needed and the KOZ information on PHY
  to make sure there is no dummy added in KOZ area on PHY by adding MIM EXCL layer).
