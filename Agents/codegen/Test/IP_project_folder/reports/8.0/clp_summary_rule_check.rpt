RTL1.2a: Variable/signal on instance INOUT port might have multiple drivers
    Type: Design     Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 203184
RTL2.5: Net is referenced without an assignment. Design verification will be based on set_undriven_signal setting
    Type: Design     Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 359244
RTL2.13: Undriven pin is detected
    Type: Design     Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 298116
RTL9.17: Cell doesn't have any output pins or all output pins are undriven (blackboxed)
    Type: Library    Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 230
RTL9.26: Liberty pin with internal_node use default input_map
    Type: Library    Severity: Note       Occurrence: 126
RTL14: Signal has input but it has no output
    Type: Design     Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 175404
    Type: Library    Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 96
RTL14.1: Fanout load of the signal is removed
    Type: Design     Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 1546
IGN3.2: Duplicate modules/entities are detected. Subsequent modules/entities are ignored
    Type: Library    Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 2
HRC3.5a: Open input/inout port connection is detected
    Type: Design     Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 5507
HRC3.5b: Open output port connection is detected
    Type: Design     Severity: Note       Occurrence: 7362
HRC3.10a: An input port is declared, but it is not completely used in the module
    Type: Design     Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 516147
HRC3.16: A wire is declared, but not used in the module
    Type: Design     Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 4479
LIB_LINT_015: Level shifter does not have the required attribute setting to decide its valid location
    Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 1
LIB_LINT_034: Nominal conditions of macro cell are extracted for domains which can work with single nominal voltage
    Severity: Note       Occurrence: 1
LIB_LINT_040: Ground pin defined as "pwell" type is not related to a primary, backup, or internal type ground pin
    Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 18
LIB_LINT_067: Cell is extracted as a macro cell because it either has multiple power or ground pins or at least one of its data pins has is_isolated: true attribute specified.
    Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 18
LIB_LINT_068: PG_PIN direction is changed to "input", which is compatible with the defined PG_TYPE.
    Severity: Warning    Occurrence: 2
