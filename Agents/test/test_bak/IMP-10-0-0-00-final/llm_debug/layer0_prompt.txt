## Task: Understand Check Intent (Layer 0)

Based ONLY on the description and file names below, perform semantic analysis.
Do NOT guess file content - focus on understanding the CHECK PURPOSE.

## Description
Confirm the netlist/spef version is correct.

## Input Files (names only)
  - sta_post_syn.log

## CRITICAL: Distinguish Target vs Source

**Check Target**: What needs to be verified (the actual data to check)
**Data Source**: Where to get the information (may be indirect)

Example: "Confirm the netlist/spef version is correct"
- Check Target: SPEF's *VERSION field, Netlist's version comment
- Data Source: STA_Log contains PATHS to SPEF/Netlist files (indirect reference)
- The STA_Log is NOT the target - it's the source that tells us WHERE to find targets

## Output Requirements

Generate JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "check_target": "What is being verified (one sentence)",
  "involved_formats": [
    {
      "name": "Format name (e.g., SPEF, Netlist_Verilog, STA_Log)",
      "role": "Role in this check (e.g., source of parasitic data)",
      "expected_sections": ["Key sections to look for"],
      "criticality": "required | optional",
      "data_role": "direct_source | indirect_reference"
    }
  ],
  "data_flow": "How data flows between formats (e.g., A → compare with → B)",
  "extraction_chain": "Step-by-step data extraction path (e.g., STA_Log → extract paths → parse SPEF → verify version)",
  "success_criteria": "What defines PASS (be specific)",
  "failure_criteria": "What defines FAIL (be specific)",
  "format_hints": {
    "FormatName": "Hint about this format (e.g., IEEE standard, tool-specific)"
  }
}
```

## Guidelines

1. **data_role** (NEW - most important):
   - "direct_source": The actual file to parse for verification data (e.g., SPEF for version check)
   - "indirect_reference": Log/report that CONTAINS REFERENCES to target files (e.g., STA_Log containing SPEF path)
   - If log file only contains PATHS to other files, it's "indirect_reference"
   - If log file itself IS the data source (e.g., checking for errors IN the log), it's "direct_source"

2. **criticality** rules:
   - "required": Format is essential for the check to work
   - "optional": Format provides supplementary information

3. **extraction_chain**: Must describe the complete data flow
   - Example: "STA_Log → extract SPEF path → parse SPEF *VERSION → compare with pattern"
   - If target and source are same file: "Synthesis_Log → search error patterns → count occurrences"

4. **expected_sections**: 
   - For standard formats (SPEF, DEF, SDC), list known section names
   - For logs, list expected keywords (Slack, WNS, Error, etc.)

5. **Format name normalization**:
   - SPEF files → "SPEF"
   - Verilog/SystemVerilog netlists → "Netlist_Verilog"  
   - STA logs/reports → "STA_Log"
   - DEF files → "DEF"
   - SDC files → "SDC"

Output ONLY the JSON, no explanation.
